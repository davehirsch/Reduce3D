To Do:
	
Need to fix MCF problem; compare to old version

Fix random crashing problem

Add to help:  can hold down shift-option during envelope creation and envelope data will be saved to desktop.

Display estimate of total time to envelope completion in progress

Error Handling - need to add auto-removing window after set time

Add better logging to log file

Need more checks for cancel button

Be sure that we aren't doing any primitive fitting or hull stuff if bounds are present in the file.

explicitly record format of versioned integrate files in docs.  Then use the version to do a better job of 
parsing the input files.


for writing envelope int files:
/*	} else {
		mProgress->SetActionDescriptor("Writing Envelope File");
		// write identifier for envelope file
		firstLine += " Envelope Output; Run number ";
		firstLine += (LStr255) (SInt32) inEnvRun;
		firstLine += "; Original Mean Radius = ";
		firstLine += FltStr(inOldMeanR, 5);
		firstLine += "; New Mean Radius = ";
		firstLine += FltStr(inNewMeanR, 5);
	}
*/

sloccount output:
(note that it can't handle .mm files, and some must be .m some must be .cpp.  Also it needs C++ to be .cpp not .cp)
Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):

objc:          1140 (13.02%)
