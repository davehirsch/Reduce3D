To Do:

Error Handling - need to add auto-removing window after set time

Add better logging to log file

Need more checks for cancel button

Modify FindBestPrimitive to use bounds in file if present as starting point

for writing envelope int files:
/*	} else {
		mProgress->SetActionDescriptor("Writing Envelope File");
		// write identifier for envelope file
		firstLine += " Envelope Output; Run number ";
		firstLine += (LStr255) (SInt32) inEnvRun;
		firstLine += "; Original Mean Radius = ";
		firstLine += FltStr(inOldMeanR, 5);
		firstLine += "; New Mean Radius = ";
		firstLine += FltStr(inNewMeanR, 5);
	}
*/


explicitly record format of versioned integrate files in docs.  Then use the version to do a better job of 
parsing the input files.

sloccount output:
(note that it can't handle .mm files, and some must be .m some must be .cpp.  Also it needs C++ to be .cpp not .cp)
